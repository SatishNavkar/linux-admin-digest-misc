==== File-system related ===

+ Tell me names of any five important files in the Linux ? ex: /etc/fstab /var/log/messages /var/log/sa/sarXX ..

+ Tell me names of any five important directories in the Linux ? ex: /dev /proc /sys /root /bin

+ How to check metadata of LVM ? $cat /etc/lvm/archive/<vg>_xxx.vg -also in = /etc/lvm/backup

  - 3ways: [1] dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 | hexdump -C
           [2] hd -n 512 /dev/sda
           [3] dd if=/dev/sda of=/xyz bs=512 count=1 <Enter> then read file "/xyz"

+ How to fill FS/hard-drive using dd / what is sparse file ?

  - many ways (dont use "seek" in dd)  dd if=/dev/zero of=filename bs=$((1024*1024)) count=$((10*1024))
  - Simpler way - fallocate -l 150G

+ How to list only links in Linux ? ex: many ways but basic idea is >> find . -type l -ls

==== Networking Related =====

+ HBA port finding in Linux ? or scanning : echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/hostX/scan .. echo "channel(-) SCSI-target-ID(-) LUN(-)"

+ How to check link-speed and duplex for NIC ? : ethtool ethX

+ In bonding how to change active link(slave) on line ?

  - cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0 -- to see bonding info like slaves/policy/active-slave elastic
  - ifenslave -c bondX <2nd-nic> ----c stands for “change active”

+ How to change active faulty NIC within bonding online ?

  - Steps -- 1> change active slave to secondary one in bond ; 2> Add new healthy NIC; 3> Remove faulty NIC; 4> change active-slave to new-NIC;
  - method1 : cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0; ifenslave -c bondX <2nd-nic>; ifenslave bondX <new-nic>; ifenslave -d bondX <old-pri-nic
  - method2 : cat /sys/class/net/bondX/bonding/slaves; echo -<old-pri-nic> > /sys/.../slaves; echo +<new-nic> > /sys/.../slaves
  - make above changes permanent >> rm /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<old-pri-nic> ; vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<new-nic>

+ BNY : What is VLAN tagging ??

+ MTU,ttl, ... concepts

+ Bonding config file ? : /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bondX = bond ?? /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<nic> = slave ??
