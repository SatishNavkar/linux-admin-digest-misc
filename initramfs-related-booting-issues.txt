--- Basic booting/initramfs troubleshooting ---

Agenda:
- Basic troubleshooting initramfs file
- How to extract data from the initramfs files and how to compare easily.

Use cases
- System is able to boot with the previously installed kernels while unable to boot with new kernel.
- System failed to boot after an update.

Common cause for the issue.
- Incomplete/missing initramfs build while kernel is installed
- Incomplete kernel installtion of kernel package
- Missing modules in the initramfs files
- LVM filters

Data to be gathered.
- Screenshot of the issue after removing 'rhgb' and 'quiet' parameters. This will help us to get some basic idea about issue.
- Sosreport from the rescue mode or if customer is able to boot into previously installed kernel.
- Initramfs files for the working and non working kernel.

Basic checks :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Compare grub.conf files for new and old kernel
- Check the kernel packages installed in the system
- check the initramfs files in the /boot directory from sosreport

Demo with Examples:
 - Missing initramfs files after system upgrade
 - Misconfiguration of LVM filters in the system
 - Missing important storage modules after patching
 - Glibc modules missing in the initramfs
